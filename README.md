# SimplyScore 
The purpose of this project is to convert the internationally used MusicXML file into a simple musical notation format that is easy for Chinese people to understand.

## Guidance
Firstly, install the required font for simplified music score in `fonts/`.

Secondly, install the required libs:`pip3 install python-docx`.

Then, copy your MusicXML to `music.xml`.

Lastly, run `main.py` and check `output.docx` for the compiled score.
